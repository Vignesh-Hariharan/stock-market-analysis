## 🚀 Setup Instructions

Get StockSense up and running with these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stocksense.git
   cd stocksense
   ```

2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Chrome WebDriver**
   - Download the appropriate version of ChromeDriver
   - Update the path in `src/scraper.py`

5. **Set Up Your Data Warehouse**
   - Create a Snowflake or Redshift account
   - Update connection details in `src/etl_pipeline.py`

6. **Launch the Data Pipeline**
   ```
   python src/scraper.py  # Initiate real-time data collection
   python src/etl_pipeline.py  # Load data into your warehouse
   ```

7. **Train the AI Model**
   ```
   python src/model.py
   ```

8. **Visualize Your Insights**
   - Connect Tableau or Power BI to your data warehouse
   - Import the predictions.csv file for visualization

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Web Scraping**: Real-time stock data is scraped from financial websites using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
2. **Data Storage**: Scraped data is initially saved as CSV files in the `data/` directory.
3. **ETL Process**: Data is extracted from CSV, transformed, and loaded into Snowflake/Redshift using SQLAlchemy.
4. **Machine Learning**: Historical data is used to train an LSTM model for price predictions.
5. **Visualization**: Actual and predicted stock prices are visualized using Tableau or Power BI.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

StockSense uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical trends. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and trained on scaled historical price data.
