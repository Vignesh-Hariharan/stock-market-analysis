## 🚀 Setup Instructions

(Setup instructions remain the same as in the original README)

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Web Scraping**: Real-time stock data is scraped from financial websites using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
2. **Data Storage**: Scraped data is initially saved as CSV files in the `data/` directory.
3. **ETL Process**: Data is extracted from CSV, transformed, and loaded into Snowflake/Redshift using SQLAlchemy.
4. **Machine Learning**: Historical data is used to train an LSTM model for price predictions.
5. **Visualization**: Various visualizations are generated and saved in the `output/` directory.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

StockSense uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical trends. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and trained on scaled historical price data.
