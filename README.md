## 🚀 Setup Instructions

(Setup instructions remain the same as in the original README)

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **Web Scraping**: Real-time stock data is scraped from financial websites using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
2. **Data Storage**: Scraped data is initially saved as CSV files in the `data/` directory.
3. **ETL Process**: Data is extracted from CSV, transformed, and loaded into Snowflake/Redshift using SQLAlchemy.
4. **Machine Learning**: Historical data is used to train an LSTM model for price predictions.
5. **Visualization**: Various visualizations are generated and saved in the `output/` directory.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

StockSense uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical trends. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and trained on scaled historical price data.

## 📈 Outputs and Visualizations

StockSense generates a variety of outputs to provide comprehensive insights:

1. **Candlestick Charts**: Interactive HTML charts for AAPL, MSFT, and GOOGL stocks.
   - `AAPL_candlestick.html`, `MSFT_candlestick.html`, `GOOGL_candlestick.html`

2. **Advanced Technical Indicator Plots**: HTML-based interactive charts with various technical indicators.
   - `AAPL_advanced_technical.html`, `MSFT_advanced_technical.html`, `GOOGL_advanced_technical.html`

3. **Summary Statistics**: CSV files containing key statistical measures for each stock.
   - `AAPL_summary_statistics.csv`, `MSFT_summary_statistics.csv`, `GOOGL_summary_statistics.csv`

4. **Seasonal Decomposition**: PNG images showing trend, seasonal, and residual components of each stock's time series.
   - `AAPL_seasonal_decomposition.png`, `MSFT_seasonal_decomposition.png`, `GOOGL_seasonal_decomposition.png`

5. **Correlation Heatmap**: A PNG image visualizing the correlation between different stocks.
   - `correlation_heatmap.png`

All these outputs can be found in the `output/` directory of the project.
