## üåü Project Overview

StockSense is a cutting-edge platform that leverages real-time data and artificial intelligence to provide unparalleled insights into stock market trends and predictions. By combining advanced web scraping techniques, robust ETL processes, cloud-based data warehousing, state-of-the-art machine learning models, and interactive data visualizations, StockSense empowers investors to make informed decisions with confidence.

### üîë Key Features

- **Real-time Data Scraping**: Stay ahead of the market with up-to-the-minute stock information.
- **Robust ETL Pipeline**: Efficiently process and load data into a scalable cloud data warehouse.
- **Intelligent Storage**: Leverage the power of Snowflake or Redshift for efficient data management.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Utilize LSTM neural networks to forecast market trends.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Gain deep insights through stunning, interactive data representations.

## üìä Data Flow

1. **Web Scraping**: Real-time stock data is scraped from financial websites using Selenium and BeautifulSoup.
2. **Data Storage**: Scraped data is initially saved as CSV files in the `data/` directory.
3. **ETL Process**: Data is extracted from CSV, transformed, and loaded into Snowflake/Redshift using SQLAlchemy.
4. **Machine Learning**: Historical data is used to train an LSTM model for price predictions.
5. **Visualization**: Various visualizations are generated and saved in the `output/` directory.

## üß† Machine Learning Model

StockSense uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future stock prices based on historical trends. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and trained on scaled historical price data.
